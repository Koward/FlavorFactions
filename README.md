# FlavorFactions

This AddOn allows you to see all factions of NPCs in tooltips, even if it has no reputation attached.
That means factions like the **Scourge**, the **Dragonmaw Clan** or the **Razormane Quillboars** are now displayed in-game.

Some old factions removed by Blizzard during 1.6 are also back like the Silvermoon Remnants and the Revantusk Trolls.

Why? Because why not!

FlavorFactions just adds an additional small detail of lore and has no practical purpose
 (except perhaps some help to guess if mobs are linked).
 
### Notes
- AddOn is for World of Warcraft Classic at the moment, although it may be expanded to Retail in the future.
- Base faction data comes from the game itself. Small fixes are added where Blizzard made some mistakes.
- Help is welcome, do not hesitate to contribute!
